 <h2>Java Tutorials on practical examples</h2>
 <p>This is experimental website for hands-on Java examples. In order
to follow the exercises you should already know basic syntax. Especially control flow statements, loops,
variables, arrays. But even if you are a complete beginner, the below first tutorial is not that hard.  </p>

 <h2>FizzBuzz implementation in Java</h2> <span>12 May 2018</span>
 <p>FizzBuzz is a very simple exercise. Usually FizzBuzz is used to weed
  out potential candidates for the position of Junior Developer.</p>

<p>In FizzBuzz the program should print Fizz if the number is divisible by 3,
print Buzz if the number is divisible by 5 and print FizzBuzz if the number 
is divisible both by 3 and 5 at the same time.</p>

<p>Almost every known FizzBuzz implementation uses modulus operator % 
which shows the number that is left after division, i.e. the remainder
of the division. For example how many times can you fit 5 in 17. That will be
3 times plus there is number 2 that remains after. Thus 17%5 = 2. </p>

<p>Below code snippet shows my implementation of FizzBuzz. It is not ideal.
But this is a point of FizzBuzz, there are many ways you can implement it.
That is probably one of the reasons it is used to check for basic programming skills.</p>
